# 2048-GAME

This MATLAB script implements a simple version of the 2048 game. It initializes a 4x4 game board, adds two random tiles, and enters a loop where it asks the user for a move direction (`w`, `s`, `a`, `d`). Tiles slide and merge in the specified direction, and a new tile is added after each move. The game continues until there are no valid moves left. Functions handle displaying the board, adding random tiles, and moving tiles in various directions. The game ends when no more moves are possible.
